#### This folder contains:
- 24 audio files extracted from the DAMP Smule Dataset in the folder "wavfiles".

- The Metadata and MTurk Annotation.csv file contains details of the singers such as gender and zone (obtained from the DAMP dataset metadata). Also it contains the average pronunciation quality ratings out of 5, obtained from MTurk users (please refer to the paper for details of this experiment).

- Word-level annotations folder contains word-level markings of good or bad pronunciation by listeners. When a word is marked 1, means it is incorrectly pronounced, and blank means good pronunciation.
